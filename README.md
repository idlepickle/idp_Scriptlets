# Idlepickle's Scriptlets

Simple and small AE scripts written for various actions I realized I need while working on freelance projects.  
Could be useful for someone else out there.  

Certain things may not work and I'm not liable if anything breaks, so run these at your own discretion.  

## Usage

A couple of ways, download the scriptlets you want, then either  

1. Run them from AE's menu `Scripts > Run Script File`
2. or Install them in KBar and run from there
